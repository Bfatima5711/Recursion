//Easy level : question 2
Problem Statement: Pascal Triangle

Given:
Given a positive integer N, return the Nth row of pascal's triangle.
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients formed by summing up the elements of previous row.
The elements can be large so return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
Output: 
1 3 3 1
Explanation: 
4th row of pascal's triangle is 1 3 3 1.

Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
Output: 
1 4 6 4 1
Explanation: 
5th row of pascal's triangle is 1 4 6 4 1.

Your Task:
Complete the function nthRowOfPascalTriangle() which takes n, as input parameters and returns an array representing the answer. 
You don't to print answer or take inputs.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103

//Easy level : question 3

Problem Statement: Fibonacci series up to Nth term

Given:
You are given an integer n, return the fibonacci series till the nth(0-based indexing) term. Since the terms can become very large return the terms modulo 109+7.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 5
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 is the Fibonacci series up to the 5th term.

Example 2:
Input:
n = 10
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
Explanation:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 is the Fibonacci series up to the 10th term.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Series() which takes an Integer n as input and returns 
a Fibonacci series up to the nth term.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

Constraint:
1 <= n <= 105

Problem Statement: Insertion Sort

Given:
The task is to complete the insert() function which is used to implement Insertion Sort.


Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = { 4, 1, 3, 9, 7}
Output:
1 3 4 7 9
